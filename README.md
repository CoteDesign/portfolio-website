# portfolio-website
The source code to my graphic design portfolio website 

I'm a graphic designer learning front-end website design and UI/UX in my free time. This was my first attempt at writing a complete portfolio website from scratch. I didn't use a template or libraries (bootstrap, jquery). The goal was to create a minimalistic website that acted similar to a presentation. I liked the idea of a click or tap trigging a transition to the next project title. The media query for the phone view needs improvement. Moving forward I'd like to work on adding more Javascript to create an ineractive welcome page and other fun movements throughout the website.

The portfolio website can be viewed at http://chantelcote.com/.

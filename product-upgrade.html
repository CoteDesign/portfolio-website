				<h1>PRODUCT UPGRADE</h1>
				<h4>Project Management, Content Creation, UI &amp; UX Design </h4>
				<p>Every year INVIA releases a new version of the 4DM software with new features and usability fixes. To adapt to a modern way of upgrading they asked me to propose an all-digital way for users to upgrade their software. After talking to teams involved in the upgrade process I compiled a map showing the details of who gets what at each point, even considering problems we may run into along the way. I designed a set of emails to be sent out at each point in the process and a secret, secure web-page with instructions on installation for the final piece, putting all of the control in the customers hands. I was lead Graphic Designer and Manager of this project with the guidance of the Marketing Manager.</p>

			<h3>PROCESS</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img class="details-img" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-Project.png" alt="Mail Letter Updates">
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>Project</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>For the past few years the company had been mailing letters to the current users notifying them that a product upgrade was available for them. The response rate was less than 15&percnt; and users were missing out on a service they were paying for. It was time for them to find an all-digital solution making it easier for customers to upgrade on their own, hopefully keeping more users up to date.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Role</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>I coordinated all project information, proposed implementation methods, and designed all digital content. I reported to the Marketing Manager who provided big picture direction.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="project-details">
			<img class="details-img" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-Users.png" alt="Users Medical professionals">
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>Users</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>The users are medical professionals, doctors and technicians, who work in hospitals and clinics. We found that they spend more time with patients than working on a computer. Most medical professionals find technology very frustrating. They like to know all of the facts before agreeing to an upgrade and they prefer talking to a product specialist in person when they need help. Majority of doctors do not like change and so we learned that they are less likely to agree to an upgrade, especially if they installed within the past two years.</p>

		<div class="project-details">
			<img class="details-img" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-DesignProcess.png" alt="Digital Process with Web and Email">
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>Design Process</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>Research to start; by reviewing the old upgrade process, interviewed team members about additional required content, and looked into digital tools we could use. With this information I compiled a proposal with two potential ways the users could upgrade through our website and email notifications. We decided on the one that had the least amount of INVIA involvement.</p>
				<p>From here I designed mock-ups of the emails, web pages, wrote content, and wrote out each user’s digital pathway to see if there were any gaps to fill. Once approved, I coded the emails in Dreamweaver, designed graphics in Illustrator, and created the web pages in Muse.</p>

		<div class="project-details">
			<h3>EMAILS</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="details-div3">
				<h4>Objective</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>Knowing that our users preferred simple, more traditional communication we decided to go for a letter style email with information on how the upgrade would benefit them and what to expect with this new method of upgrading. Since some users are not tech-savvy we included instructions on how to reply if they are interested in upgrading and some imagery to support written steps. With the exciting news of a new software release we wanted to have fresh and exciting colors to pull out important points.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="details-div2">
				<h4 class="secondary-text">New 4DM Upgrade Email</h4>
				<p>This is the first email users would receive notifying them of their eligibility to upgrade. Key enhancements to the new 4DM software are called out as well as a feature list they can download right there. Information on what to expect if they agree to an upgrade is summarized along with a discount for user training so everyone is on the same page. To try to avoid future frustrations recommended system requirements are noted at the end. Users are encouraged to click the button to reply, this triggers an email with pre-populated text.</p>

		<div class="project-details">
			<div class="details-div2">
				<h4 class="secondary-text">Upgrade Instructions Email</h4>
				<p>After users reply, within 24 hours INVIA would respond with a second email providing them with an upgrade number unique to that user, their new license file, the link to the 4DM software, and a set of instructions on how to upgrade.</p>

			<h3>WEBSITE</h3>
			<br>
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>Online Advertisement</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>This is the online announcement notifying users of the new 4DM release. Key enhancements to the new 4DM software are called out as well as a place where they can find information packets. This is for users who didn’t receive an email notification and want to upgrade. They could request an upgrade by filling out a form letting us know they are interested.</p>

		</div>
		<img class="p-imgs" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-Website1.png" alt="image of web pages advertising the upgrade">
		<div class="project-details">
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>4DM Download</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>From the second email users would sign in to this private web page using their upgrade number. Here they would download the 4DM software. All the tools they need to upgrade are on this page; a PDF of step by step instructions on installing an upgrade, INVIA Support contact if they need help, and all user training collateral.</p>

			<h3>PROJECT LAUNCH</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img class="details-img" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-Validation.png" alt="validation of digital design">
			<div class="details-div">
				<h4>Validation</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>Before launching we personally tested each pathway and I made last minute adjustments. To make sure our emails and website pages worked we sent out three emails to coworkers’ home emails. They stepped through the process and guaranteed all elements worked. To launch I passed all emails over to the Marketing Manager who would be sending them out.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>Constraints &amp; Limitations</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<ul>
					<li>1 month to complete</li>
			
					<li>Upper management did not want INVIA Product Specialists involved in the upgrade process, unless the user has a unique situation. Users must be able to upgrade all on their own.</li>
					
					<li>Hospitals have high security and limited access to internet so we needed a backup plan for users with these constraints.</li>
					
					<li>In large hospitals it takes a long time for upgrades to get approved and then planned for so we couldn’t put a hard end date to the offer.</li>
					
					<li>We had no way of knowing if the user received the email or if the user still worked there so we made sure to have a second contact.</li>
					
					<li>I was new to HTML emails and the whole email design was a learning moment for me.</li>
					
					<li>I had to design with older Windows versions in mind.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<img class="details-img" src="img/4DM-Upgrade-Outcome.png" alt="successful outcome">
			<div class="details-div" id="last-div">
				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<div class="underline"></div>
				<p>The project was released with much success. We sent emails to a total of 64 users who were eligible for an upgrade. 25 users responded and 16 completed the upgrade within the first month. That’s a 25&percnt; increase from the previous upgrade method. Another benefit is it proved to the company that they could provide their product as a download from the web. This experience taught me how to communicate with different teams within the company and showed me all of the pieces involved in something as simple as an upgrade. Next time I would suggest investing in a better email service so emails are placed in the right inbox folder, we used one that we already had.</p>
